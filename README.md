# Diversify Watch Face 

> I created a watch face for Samsung Wear OS (Android) enhancing user-experience and leveraging human factors design to digital health and stroke rehabilitation. It’s a clean, complication-driven face (Android Watch Face Format XML + custom providers) that supports an app counting upper-extremity movement, with a progress ring for the daily goal and a tap target suggesting proposed exercises.
A watch face is the home screen of a smartwatch. On Wear OS, it renders time/date and can surface **live data “complications”**; small UI regions powered by system or app-provided data sources (steps, goals, battery, custom metrics, etc.). A well-designed watch face lets users glance key information with **zero navigation** and **near-zero cognitive load**.

## Why complications? (And why this matters for stroke recovery)

Complications let us show **one or two critical metrics** with strong visual affordances, instead of burying information in menus. For people in stroke rehabilitation, this is especially important:

* **Good UI:** fewer items, bigger type, high contrast.
* **Progress cues:** **RANGED_VALUE** progress rings provide immediate “how far am I?” feedback without reading, which has been proven to be beneficial in rehabilitation..
* **Plain language labels:** **SHORT_TEXT** lets us annotate the metric (“active”, “wear time”, “battery”).
* **Ambient clarity:** simplified elements in ambient mode reduce visual clutter while preserving status and saving battery.

## Complications in this watch face
This repo’s example emphasizes: **one primary progress ring**, **two supporting rings**, **one circular label**, and large, readable time/date.

* `watchface.xml` — a complete **Watch Face Format** XML that defines:

    * A **RANGED_VALUE** progress ring (e.g., “active movement minutes”, “therapy goal”, etc.).
    * A **SHORT_TEXT** left complication (e.g., emoji + label such as “exercises”).
    * A **RANGED_VALUE** top complication for **wear time** (minutes/hours on wrist).
    * A **RANGED_VALUE** right complication for **battery** indicator.
    * Large, legible **digital time** and **date**.
    * Color **theme configuration** users can select.

You can plug in your own complication providers or use the defaults included.

### RANGED_VALUE

* **What it is:** Numeric value between **min** and **max**; perfect for goals and progress.
* **How it renders here:** **Circular progress rings** with labels, plus value readouts (e.g., “2h15’”).
* **Where used:**

    * **Slot 0**: Full-screen main progress (**MyProgressComplicationProviderService**).
    * **Slot 2**: **Wear time** ring (**MyWearTimeComplicationProviderService**).
    * **Slot 3**: **Battery** ring (**System: WATCH_BATTERY** by default).

### SHORT_TEXT

* **What it is:** Brief text string (optionally with an icon/emoji).
* **How it renders here:** Centered emoji/text inside a slim ring, plus a bottom caption.
* **Where used:**

    * **Slot 1**: Left emoji/text that opens proposed exercises (**MyComplicationProviderService**).
    * **Slot 4**: Restart/status text (**MyServiceAliveCheckComplicationProviderService**) inside a pressable circular region.

> The XML already specifies **default providers** so the face remains useful even without your custom services (e.g., steps, battery).

## Health-oriented UI principles baked into the XML

* **Single dominant metric:** A larger ring (Slot 0) makes the primary health goal unmistakable.
* **Big, readable time & date:** The clock sits on top of everything for constant visibility.
* **Ambient mode simplification:** Rings/text fade or move in ambient for clean low-power glanceability.
* **Color themes:** A light set of curated palettes supports contrast preferences and situational lighting.
* **Tap regions sized generously:** Interactive/centered areas (e.g., Restart) are easy to hit.

## How to plug in your data
> Take a look at my providers. You can change them to access your data
* **MyProgressComplicationProviderService** → emits a `RANGED_VALUE` (e.g., active minutes toward goal).
* **MyWearTimeComplicationProviderService** → emits a `RANGED_VALUE` derived from daily “watch-worn” minutes.
* **MyComplicationProviderService** → emits a `SHORT_TEXT` (emoji or brief label).
* **MyServiceAliveCheckComplicationProviderService** → emits status text (e.g., “RESTART”/“ALIVE”) as `SHORT_TEXT`.

## The .xml CODE
* **Face basics:** 450×450 **DIGITAL** watch face.
* **Themes:** User-selectable palettes via `themeColor`; reference colors as `[CONFIGURATION.themeColor.N]`.
* **Clock & date:** Shows date and time, with a thinner font in ambient.

**Complication slots**
* **Slot 0 — RANGED_VALUE (Main progress ring):** custom provider; circular bounds; sweep angle; value shown as `h'm` and label “active”; rendered only when data exists.
* **Slot 1 — SHORT_TEXT (Left emoji/label):** custom provider; circular bounds; red border, emoji/text, “exercises”; only shown in active mode.
* **Slot 2 — RANGED_VALUE (Wear time, top):** custom wear-time; ring + watch icon + `h'm` + “wear time”; only shown in active mode.
* **Slot 3 — RANGED_VALUE (Battery, right):** system WATCH_BATTERY; ring + icon + `%` + “battery”; active-only.
* **Slot 4 — SHORT_TEXT (Restart, bottom-center):** tap-enabled button; gray border + green fill + provider text.

**Useful to know**
* `<UserConfigurations>` with `ColorConfiguration` (theme options).
* `<ComplicationSlot>` blocks for Slots **0..4** with **supportedTypes** set to `RANGED_VALUE` or `SHORT_TEXT`.
* `<DefaultProviderPolicy>` pointing to your custom providers (and safe system fallbacks).
* `<Variant mode="AMBIENT">` sections to simplify visuals when the device is in ambient mode.
* `<DigitalClock>` and date **PartText** for time/date layers rendered last (on top).
* `when=[COMPLICATION.HAS_DATA]` gates drawing. The providers decide if the complication is shown or not.
* **BoundingOval** defines circular clip/tap regions (recommended for ring/round UI).
* **Transform endAngle** maps normalized value → 0–360°.
* `"%sh%s'"` template converts total minutes → hours:minutes.
